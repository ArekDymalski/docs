<a name="introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Backlift wants to make building and deploying websites easier, faster and more creative. 

</p>
<p>Backlift&#39;s server, templates and helper libraries support:

</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asynchronous updates:</strong> Build apps that respond immediately to user actions while data is sent the the server in the background. </li>
<li><strong>API discovery:</strong> Backlift will let you persist data without specifying the API up front. If you follow standard RESTful conventions, backlift will accept whatever data you throw at it.</li>
<li><strong>Familiar libraries:</strong> Backlift currently works with <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a>. We plan to integrate other javascript MVC libraries in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Backlift&#39;s goals are to facilitate:

</p>
<ul>
<li>rapid user experience prototyping,</li>
<li>learning to write front-end javascript code, and eventually,</li>
<li>deploying production websites used by millions.</li>
</ul>

<a name="philosophy-lite"></a><h2>Philosophy (lite)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Backlift doesn&#39;t want to change the way you work, it wants to reduce your workload. </li>
<li>Backlift isn&#39;t a new library or API, it works with existing libraries, such as Backbone.js.</li>
<li>Backlift doesn&#39;t want to lock you in. The code you deploy to backlift can be used with a different stack. If at some point you outgrow backlift, you can migrate to a different back-end without rewriting your front-end code.</li>
</ul>
<a name="getting-started"></a><h1>Getting Started</h1>
<a name="setup-the-backlift-command-line-utility"></a><h2>Setup the Backlift Command Line Utility</h2>
<p>Open up your terminal and download the Backlift Command Line Interface (CLI) by typing:

</p>
<pre><code>sudo easy_install backlift</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can use pip to install the Backlift CLI into a virtual environment.

</p>
<p>Once you have backlift installed, create an account at <a href="https://backlift.com">backlift.com</a> by clicking on the &#39;Sign-in&#39; button in the upper right corner. You will need a registration key. In order to obtain one please click the &#39;Get Early Access&#39; link and supply your email address. We will send you a key as soon as possible.

</p>
<p>Once you have your api-key, setup backlift with the command:

</p>
<pre><code>backlift setup &lt;api-key&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now you&#39;re ready to create new apps and upload them to backlift.

</p>
<p>From time to time you should make sure that you have the most recent version of the Backlift CLI. You can check that by typing <code>backlift --version</code>. It should match the &#39;Backlift CLI current version&#39; listed on your account dashboard. You can update your Backlift CLI by entering the command 

</p>
<pre><code>sudo easy_install --update backlift.</code></pre>
<a name="create-and-upload-a-new-app"></a><h2>Create and Upload a new app</h2>
<p>Create a new app with the command:

</p>
<pre><code>backlift create newapp</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new folder in the current directory called &#39;newapp&#39; and begin downloading the backlift default project template. Once the project template has finished downloading, check it out by opening the &#39;newapp&#39; folder with a text editor.

</p>
<p>To see this app running on a public web server, first change directories into the &#39;newapp&#39; folder and type &#39;backlift push&#39;.

</p>
<pre><code>cd newapp
backlift push</code></pre>
<p>This will upload the content of the &#39;newapp&#39; folder to Backlift. Alternatively you can use the command:
    <code>backlift watch</code>

</p>
<p>The watch command will first upload the &#39;newapp&#39; folder and then wait for changes to the project. Any time you edit and save a file in the &#39;newapp&#39; folder while the watch command is running, your changes will automatically by synced to Backlift.


</p>
<a name="view-and-manage-your-app"></a><h2>View and manage your app</h2>
<p>You can launch a browser to view your app by typing:

</p>
<pre><code>backlift open</code></pre>
<p>You can alternatively view the website&#39;s admin page by typing:

</p>
<pre><code>backlift admin</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s all there is to it! The basic Backlift template contains a tutorial that will show you how to build a backbone.js app with Backlift.
